            <h3>A little about us...</h3>
            <p> Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day to day operations. <br>
                We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.
                We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism.
                We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
                You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again. 
                Itâ€™s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.

            <h3>What we offer...</h3>
            <p>My understanding is Vicious Cycle is a locally owned store for every type of bicycle terrain. It is a dealer for Trek Bicycle Corporation and Connondale bikes.
            In addition to selling bikes, Vicious Cycle also sells high quality accessories. Vicious Cycle sells to bikers that know what they want when they come into the store and treat cycling as a lifestyle.<br>
